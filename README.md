# Oqulus-Data-Formatting-Program
Made to ease data formatting of Oqulus Project.

Currently takes a file input and calculates some basic numbers based on number values in columns inside that file.

Can output a simple text pdf.

Ultimate goal will be a program which can iterate through X amount of files and output a pdf for each file for quick data form creation.

## Please note:
Requires used of jsPDF which can be downloaded here: https://parall.ax/products/jspdf#
